Temperature Monitoring System

Components Required:

1. Arduino Board:
   - Arduino Nano.

2. Temperature Sensor:
   - LM35 Temperature Sensor: This sensor outputs a voltage that is proportional to the temperature in degrees Celsius.

3. Liquid Crystal Display (LCD):
   - 16x2 LCD: A common LCD used for displaying text. Make sure it has an appropriate interface (HD44780 compatible).

4. LED:
   - Standard LED: Used to indicate when the temperature exceeds the set threshold.

5. Resistor:
   - 220Î© Resistor: For limiting the current through the LED to prevent damage.

6. Breadboard and Jumper Wires:
   - Breadboard: For making connections without soldering.
   - Jumper Wires: To connect the components on the breadboard.

7. Power Supply:
   - USB Cable: To power the Arduino from a computer or a suitable external power supply (like a battery or adapter).

Summary of Connections:

- LM35 Sensor:
  - Connect VCC (pin 1) to 5V on Arduino.
  - Connect GND (pin 3) to GND on Arduino.
  - Connect the output (pin 2) to the analog pin A0.

- LCD:
  - Connect RS to pin 12 on Arduino.
  - Connect EN to pin 11 on Arduino.
  - Connect D4 to pin 5, D5 to pin 4, D6 to pin 3, and D7 to pin 2 on Arduino.
  - Connect VSS to GND, VDD to 5V, and V0 to GND (or potentiometer for contrast adjustment).

- LED:
  - Connect the anode (longer leg) to pin 13 on Arduino and the cathode (shorter leg) to one end of the resistor. Connect the other end of the resistor to GND.

# Temperature-Monitoring-System
The Temperature Monitoring System utilizes an Arduino and a temperature sensor to continuously measure and display ambient temperature on an LCD. This project includes a visual alert through an LED that activates when the temperature exceeds a predefined threshold, making it an effective tool for monitoring environmental conditions.
